# Deep Learning Labs

The tasks are evaluated automatically using the [ReCodEx Code
Examiner](https://recodex.mff.cuni.cz/). The evaluation is
performed using Python 3.4, TensorFlow 1.5.0, NumPy 1.14.0
and OpenAI Gym 0.9.5.

You can install TensorFlow 1.5.0 either to user packages using
`pip3 install --user tensorflow==1.5.0`, or create a virtual
environment using `python3 -m venv VENV_DIR` and then installing
TensorFlow inside it by running `VENV_DIR/bin/pip3 install tensorflow==1.5.0`.

Note that updates about the tasks (notably changes in the task descriptions) are
announced on the [UFAL NPFL114 mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ufal-npfl114).
However, the mailing list will not contain anything not present on this website.

### Teamwork

Working in teams of size 2 (or at most 3) is encouraged. All members of the team
must submit in ReCodEx individually, but can have exactly the same
sources/models/results. **However, each such solution must explicitly list all
members of the team to allow plagiarism detection using
[this template](https://github.com/ufal/npfl114/tree/master/labs/team_description.py).**
